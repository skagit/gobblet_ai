This repository contains the code and related materials for an upcoming blog post on basic AI techniques. In particular, a Gobblet playing AI is developed using the minimax algorithm and implemented efficiently using an action-based abstraction. The game rules, code design, and accompanying AI techniques will be explained and illustrated in the post.
